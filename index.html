            <p>Hi there!<br>I am a fashion, food, and now a budding web developing enthusiast. I love doing creative things like painting, sewing and, picking roadside plants/flowers to create small displays. I have a background in content creation and used to film and photograph plant-based recipes for a blog. I also have a sales background and worked for a leading fabric wholesaler in NZ which sold beautiful, imported textiles from all over the world. Recently after a bit of a deep dive into web development and UX design I found I enjoyed the challenge in creating web experiences using code. I believe this would pair well with my background in design and help me create digital solutions that are unique and exciting.</p>

                    <p><strong>Fashion Design</strong><br>I have previously completed a Bachelor in Fashion Design (2018) at AUT. I continue to use the skill I mastered there to design a product that is fit for the brief. We were really encouraged to think outside the box to create unique and authentic designs and this is something I continue to implement in my work today. I have also received mentorship from Supriya Lele, a London based designer who further helped me develop my design ability.</p>

                    <p><strong>Content Creation</strong><br>I have an innate interest in content creation, and I worked with the founder at Be Good Organics to create content for her food blog, social media and cooking school. Here, I worked across many medians including photography, video, and digital design. I was particular proud of the work we did for Be Good Organics Cooking School which we developed and launched during my time there. You can find the website <a href="https://cookingschool.begoodorganics.com/" target="_blank">here</a></p>

                    <p><strong>Workshop37</strong><br>Workshop37 is a passion project between myself and a friend of mine. It’s a made-to-order fashion label that we launched earlier this year with an exhibition in Auckland. We later created a Sgshopify website and use Instagram as our predominant marketing tool. My next goal is using my newly developed coding skills to alter the looks and feel of the website – hopefully this summer!</p>
